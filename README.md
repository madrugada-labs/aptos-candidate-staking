# aptos-candidate-staking
This is a smart contract written in move on aptos chain where user can stake on a particular applicant and get rewarded if the applicant is hired.

This is a very rough module written using move. But this module achieves the following things
- Create an admin account
- Create a new job and store details related to it
- Create a new application and store details related to it
- User can stake 
- User can unstake and would get rewards if the candidate gets selected.

But this requires a bit more work around resource accounts and has to be properly tested.
